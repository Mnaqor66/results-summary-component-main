## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this challenge I learned to use Tailwind CSS, where tailwind CSS is something that I have just used after all this time I have continuously used Bootstrap, I learned it from the installation stage to configuration to how to use the classes in Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

I haven't thought about the continuation of this project, if you have an idea for the continuation of this project you can contact me.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This official website of Tailwind CSS is very helpful for me in understanding the use of Tailwind CSS.
